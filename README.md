### Advanced practical: Comparison of autoencoder and PCA for dimension reduction on the CIFAR-100 data set ###

+ in this folder are the code for the advanced practial

### Prerequisites ###

To use this code you need:

+ TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
+ Python 3.5-3.7

### Folder strucutre and content  ###

+ "cluster": in this folder is an approch to cluster images with an autoencoder, for clarity the code is split in two files.

Moreover, the figure 6 "Vergleich echte Klasse und vermutetet Klasse CIFAR-100" from page 8 of the report is in a hig resolution in this folder.  
+ "data": in this folder are information about the dataset. The file classnames.py print the 100 classnames with their numbers, this list is also in the file
